  <hr>
  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>
    The Black Car Service is a user side application for either drivers or passengers using the service. Drivers post their location data to a central sever and recieve passenger locations to be posted on an interactive map. It uses the Google Maps API to display locations and distances.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Black Car Server is the back end of this service. It takes requests for posting information to a database, then returns lists of either passengers or drivers based on what type was submitted to the database. The server also has a feature for viewing which passengers have requested vehicles and when. It utilizes a Mongo Database to store information.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been tasked with revealing potentional vulnerabilites of both the client and server sides of this application and recommending possible solutions to any issues found. 
  </p>


  <h2> Methodology </h2>
  <p>
    As a start, I black box tested the client's code. I sent various requests to the server containing compromosing commands to try and reveal vulnerabilites such as cross site scripting and input restriction bypassing. 
    <br />
    Next, I examined the source code directly to look for possible security lapses, this is known as white box testing. If any issues presented themselves, I then exploited them.
  <h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
  <p>
    Three Issues were found in the client's code:
    <ul>
      <li> Cross site scripting to access database entries </li>
      <li> Cross site scripting to rewrite contents of page </li>
      <li> MongoDB username and password are hardcoded </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2> Issues found </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> The first vulnerability found was the ability to inject malicious javascript code using the post functionality. When passengers are displayed on the index page, all entries are retrieved from the database and this script is run. I submitted code to change the actual contents of the page to a picture from a random website. </li>

      <li> The second vulnerability uncovered was the ability to access all database entries from the index page. Since I knew the user utilized a mongoDB, I was able to access all collections and even delete collections. </li>

      <li> The last problem was the fact that the client hardcoded his username and password for MongoDB in his sourcecode which allowed me to access their Mongo Page and mess with the database. </li>

    </ul>

  <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p> This client's code is implemented correctly but
