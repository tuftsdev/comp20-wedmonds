# README for Will Edmonds' Private GitHub Repo #

### Purpose
***
A repo with all of my projects from Comp 20 at Tufts University

### Favourite Assignment
***
I think my favourite assignment from this course was the notuber project. This allowed me to explore some of the more interesting aspects of javascript and AJAX. We worked with HTTPRequests, callback functions, and the google maps API, plus some jquery. The final product was tangible and functional.

### How much have I grown
***
Coming in to this course my only experience was with fairly individual C++ projects that involved pretty much large data sets and text based interaction. Moving to an environment where style, responsiveness, and collaboration were necessary was an exciting challenge that I took head on. I've become a more thoughtful and patient programmer for sure.

### Most important thing I learned
***
The top two things I learned were the difference between front end web pages and the back end of a server/website and that you can never know everything about web development, so it's okay to ask for help. I never fully understood the process that occurred when you type a URL into a browser but I definitely do now. Also the shear amount of code necessary to run a website is crazy and it's an important skill to not get caught up in semantics. 

### Delve deeper into a topic
***
I would love to revisit React and React Native to get started on some mobile development and large scale web pages with lots of moving parts and data persistance.
